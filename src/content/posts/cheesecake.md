Cheesecake is a [Wild Republic](https://www.wildrepublic.com) [Cuddlekins Fawn](https://shop.wildrepublic.com/products/fawn-stuffed-animal-12?variant=49246967333174) that a good friend of mine gifted to me for Christmas one year. I love plushies and all things deer-related (especially white-tailed deer), so ever since I got her, she has been one of my most prized belongings. And just recently, I decided to make her the mascot of my website. So make sure to say hi to her when you see her.

Her favorite hobby? Zeroing the master partition tables on people's hard drives.
