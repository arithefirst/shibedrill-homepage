Cheesecake is a [Wild Republic](https://www.wildrepublic.com) [Cuddlekins Fawn](https://shop.wildrepublic.com/products/fawn-stuffed-animal-12?variant=49246967333174) (not sponsored) that was gifted to me for Christmas one year, by my friend Lilu.

I love plushies and all things deer-related (especially white-tailed deer), so ever since I got her, she has been one of my most prized belongings. And just recently, I decided to make her the mascot of my website. So make sure to say hi to her when you see her.

Her favorite hobby? Zeroing the partition tables on people's hard drives.
