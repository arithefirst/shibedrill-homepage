## IMPORTANT: READ THIS BEFORE CONTACTING!

## IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS, I MAY BLOCK YOU!

It is important that anyone wishing to contact me reads this segment. I have a
lot of difficulty with social interaction, and if you follow these guidelines
going in, it will make things smoother for everyone involved. ***If you do not
follow these guidelines, there is a high chance I will block, mute, or ignore
you.***

These guidelines are subject to change.

### Do:

- Introduce yourself and bring up common
traits or interests.  
- Use clear and straightforward language.  
- Ask questions right away.  
- State your intentions clearly and set expectations.  

### Do Not:

- Simply say "hiiii" or send a sticker, and expect me to respond.  
- Say "Can I ask/tell you something/a question?".  
- Ask invasive questions about my personal life.  
- Attempt to flirt, date, or roleplay.
- Solicit purchase or exchange of goods or services.  
- Expect me to serve as on-call tech support.
- Expect me to serve as a therapist.
- Use sarcasm without making it somewhat obvious.  
- Mistake blunt or frank speech for me being rude or cold.
- Send unsolicited explicit or suggestive content.
